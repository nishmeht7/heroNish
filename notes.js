Difference between transpiler and compiler? 
compiler compiles code like a C++ compiler takes C++ and compiles it into machine
readible code (non-human readible)
While transpiler transpiles code into human readible code for example webpack!!
another example: node-sass transpiler takes scss and transpiles it to css
