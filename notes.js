Difference between transpiler and compiler? 
compiler compiles code like a C++ compiler takes C++ and compiles it into machine
readible code (non-human readible)
While transpiler transpiles code into human readible code for example webpack!!
another example: node-sass transpiler takes scss and transpiles it to css

ReactDom.render() is basically the root of the tree which creates the tree with all
the react components, essentially the API/entrance point to react 
ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM
we will mainly use it only for one thing which is mounting with ReactDom.render
